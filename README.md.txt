Our geodata contains (x, y) coordinates of geographical locations usually as latitude and longitude numbers.
If it can be predicted that the user will appear location B at 6:00pm based on the previous locations visited, 
the LBS provider can send the recommendation information or advertisements for restaurants in location B to the user in advance.
Gaussian mixture modeling is implemented on the serial density of each location.
Note that Lat/Long coordinates can often be used as-is with tree-based models like Random Forest or 
Gradient Boost that do not require data to be normalized. Other models such as neural network models 
would usually require those coordinates to be normalized.
